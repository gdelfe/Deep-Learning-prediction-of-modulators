## Deep Learning application to identify modulators in the monkey brain network

This project aims to use Deep Learning tools on the monkey brain neural signal to identify neural modulators of brain networks. Given a causal brain network of sender and receivers electrode (see below for their definition), modulators are electrodes which act as orchestrators of the receiver response given a sender stimulus: modulators act as a gate which opens or closes the channel of communication between senders and receivers.

**Sender and Receivers**

Senders are defined as the electrodes which are stimulated with a single-pulse microstimulation. While a sender electrode is stimulated, we simultaneously record 





contains the codes to perform the analysis of the LFP signal, the spectrogram using DL tools, such as perceptron, MLP, and CNN.
